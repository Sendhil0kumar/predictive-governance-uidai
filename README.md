# UIDAI National Data Hackathon 2026: Predictive Governance

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a multi-stage data science solution developed for the **UIDAI National Data Hackathon 2026**. The project transitions Aadhaar service management from a reactive administrative model to a **Predictive Governance Framework**.

### **The Problem: Structural Mismatch**
The Aadhaar ecosystem faces congestion due to a fixed-resource model that ignores dynamic demand surges. We analyzed **4,936,686 records** to solve for:
1. **Operational Congestion** in high-population states.
2. **Temporal Inefficiency** (identifying an -11.81 unit weekend service lag).
3. **Demographic Pressure** from youth-centric (0-17) biometrics (42.6% of volume).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
- **Framework:** CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels)
- **Modeling:** - **Diagnostic:** Random Forest Feature Importance.
  - **Predictive:** Multivariate OLS Regression ($P < 0.001$).
  - **Prescriptive:** K-Means Clustering for district-level resource allocation.
  - **Deep Governance:** Isolation Forest & LSTM-based temporal forecasting.

## 📊 Frontier Analytics & Key Findings
### **1. LSTM Forecasting**
Deployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) logic to predict a **+4.70% growth surge** for the next quarter, allowing for pre-emptive capacity buffering.

### **2. Administrative Complexity Index**
Engineered a "Friction Score" to identify zones requiring senior skill-based staffing.
- **High-Friction Leader:** Tamil Nadu (Index: 0.70)
- **Resource Forecast:** Uttar Pradesh requires **18,269 desks** for zero-backlog status.



### **3. Strategic Audit Layer**
Detected **49,224 anomalies** (top 1% risk) using a Reconstruction Risk Layer, enabling targeted governance rather than broad-stroke auditing.

## 🏛️ Strategic Recommendations
1. **Educational Hubs:** Deploy school-based kiosks to offload 42.6% of youth-centric load.
2. **Dynamic Staffing:** Shift weekend man-hours to peak Monday/Tuesday surges.
3. **Skill-Based Routing:** Utilize the Complexity Index to match expert technicians with high-friction biometric zones.
